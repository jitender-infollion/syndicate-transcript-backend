"""switch all primary and foreign keys to uuid

Sequential integer ids are guessable/enumerable (e.g. iterating order_id or
user_id to probe other users' data). This migration drops every app table and
recreates it from the updated models, where every id/foreign-key column is now
UUID instead of BigInteger. There is no in-place ALTER path from int to
unrelated UUID values, so this intentionally deletes all existing rows -
authorized as a full reset of the transcripts/orders/users data.
