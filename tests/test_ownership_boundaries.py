"""Cross-cutting regression test: proves a random authenticated user cannot
see or act on another user's data through any ID-taking endpoint. Individual
endpoints already have their own narrower tests elsewhere; this test exists
to check the boundary holistically, in one place, the way an attacker
actually would - by taking one victim's real IDs and hitting every
ownership-sensitive route with a different user's token.
